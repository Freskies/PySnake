# PySnake

PySnake is a small, classic snake game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module. Control the snake to eat food, grow, and avoid colliding with the border or itself.

The main gameplay improvement in this project is the input buffering system. This makes controls feel more responsive and prevents missed inputs during fast play.

Controls: use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`).

Run: execute `main.py` with Python 3.10+ to start the game.
